# Belly button Bacterias Research results 

The purpose of this project was to visualize the Bacterias Research  data for each volunteer of the research by using a knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js. Based on the panel for demographic information, the user  should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer's belly button. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Each volunteer has assigned ID number with basic demographic information.
